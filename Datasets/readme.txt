Data descriptions
-------------------

This dataset includes data for producing the graphs and charts in the manuscript with title "The Arctic has warmed nearly four times faster than the globe since 1979" by Rantanen et al. (2022).

-------------------
Figure 1.
The following files includes the temperature time series for the Arctic and globally
- arctic_temps_obs.csv
- global_temps_obs.csv
The following file include the gridded temperature trend (both with and without masking of statistically non-significant trends) and local 
amplification ratio
- OBSAVE_trend.nc
-------------------
Figure 2.
These two files contain the Arctic amplification ratio and its percentile in CMIP6 ensemble as shown in Fig. 2
- obs_aa_sensitivity.csv
- obs_aa_perc_cmip6.csv
-------------------
Figure 3.
The 43-year Arctic amplification ratio derived from the models can be found the following files:
- cmip5_aa_ann.csv
- cmip6_aa_ann.csv
- mpi-ge_aa_ann.csv
The 43-year Arctic amplification ratio derived from the observations can be found the following file:
- observed_aa_ann.csv
-------------------
Figure 4.
Arctic amplification ratio as a function of the starting year of the trend derived from the models can be found the following files:
- cmip5_aa_to_present.csv
- cmip6_aa_to_present.csv
- mpi-ge_aa_to_present.csv
-------------------
Figure 5.
The seasonality of Arctic amplification derived from CMIP6 models can be found from
- cmip6_aa_seasonality.zip
and for the observations
 - obs_aa_seasonality.zip
The zip-files include monthly Arctic amplification values for each month of the year (in total 12 files).
-------------------
Figure 6.
Frequency distributions of all possible 43-year AA ratios between 1970 and 2040 can be derived from 
- cmip5_aa_ann.csv 
- cmip6_aa_ann.csv
- mpi-ge_aa_ann.csv
The observational Arctic amplification ratio can be found from 
- observed_aa_ann.csv.
