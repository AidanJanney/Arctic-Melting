## netCDF Files ##
Created: 7\5\23

These adjusted files contain the same information as the similarly named files found in \Datasets. 
They have been converted to netCDF file format, and many of the necessary attributes and pieces of metadata
have been added, but they are not fully in compliance with [CF Conventions](http://cfconventions.org/).
